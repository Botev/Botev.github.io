  about:             |
    I'm a graduate student in Machine Learning at [University College London](http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk) with David Barber.
    I did an undergraduate degree in Computer Science at [University of Southampton](http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/).

    My interests are fairly broad and usually not confined to a single topic as I find many different problems
    interesting and challenging.
    Nevertheless, some of the topics I do research on are Structured Probabilistic Modelling, Optimization
    and Model Based Reinforcment Learning (all with Deep Learning).
    I also have keen interest in automatic differentiation paragadims and software for speeding up modelling
    experimentation.
    On my engineering side I like writing code in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).
