title: 'Deep Learning frameworks and Compiler Engineering'
tags: [autodiff, deeplearning]
description: >
  Deep Learning frameworks can significantly improve the performance of Machine Learning models
  and are a key ingredients in any scalable modern .
  However, are the techniques that they use novel? Is the dichotomy between imperative and
  static optimization unique to Deep Learning? In this blog post I will discuss
  the close similarity between what these frameworks do and what standard compilers do.
  I will also show a different perspective on imperative vs static model compilation
  and what should we as community try to push and expect in the future.
